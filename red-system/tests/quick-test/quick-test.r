comment {
  This script makes some assumptions about the location of files. They are:
    this script will be run from the red-system/tests directory
    the test scripts will be in the red-system/tests/source directories
    this script resides in the red-system/tests/quick-test directory
    the compiler will reside in the red-system directory
    the source of the programmes being tested are in red-system/tests/source directories
    the exe of the program being tested will be created in red-system/builds
    (quick-test will move the executable to red-system/runnable.)
}
